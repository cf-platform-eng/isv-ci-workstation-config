# Set up mac
I got my mac at the NY office, so I was able to sign it onto the network and use remote management from the start.


For consistancy:

**Username**: pivotal


# Initial launch

1. Removed all the dock icons. They drive me crazy :D
1. App store
    1. I signed in with my work email as an app store id.
    1. updates. I apply them all
    1. install **xcode**. Just so it's there already, we know it's wanted later
    1. Mac update (if it's a version of OSX that's currently supported)
    1. I turned off automatic updates, I prefer to be nagged less for restarts
